# learningGo
This is my attempt to learn the go language


## My first go program
This is my best attempt to make a random number guessing game in go.
I thiI think I failed and did not do good, but the good news is that the
only place I can go from here is up.


## First Impressions
Go seems like a cool language based on all of the examples I have seen.
It has a really clean syntax that I like, but there is a little weirdness.
For examples what on earth does := copared to =. Overall, I am really 
exicited to be picking up the langauge. I am excited to use it as pretty
much just a faster version of python and I want to learn how OOP works 
in go to, and maybe it is better than rust, who knows?
